                was introduced to programming in my college with every semister there being a new lagnguage in the
                syllabus.After toggling through all that for over whole 2 years,i came across Web Development and was
                instantly drawn towdards it. I chose to go with FRONTEND and i like it so far reason being you see what
                you have made instead of looking for missed semicolons and just a terminal; <br> I've build this
                personal website so far and i'm still learning new things everyday to imporove upon my current skills.
